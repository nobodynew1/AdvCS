Workout Tracker!

### Name and Team members
Daniel Robinson

###  Summary
This project will be about making an app to track your workout routines in the gym throughout the week/month/year.

The main audience for this project are those who go to the gym semi regularly, and are looking for a more user friendly way to track their progress. As I mainly do weight lifting and cardio, those will be
the exercises I would incorporate first. I would also have sections to show your previous records, notes on form, and other advice that would be useful going forward. Though currently I'm imagining you 
would have to add those notes yourself, perhaps I could add presets for specific exercises that will already come with recommendations on how to do them properly.

### Resources
I would want to find a good color scheme and layout that would make the app seem more welcoming.

### Programming languages, frameworks, or technologies
I think I would be using html for the main interfact, and perhaps javascript to keep track of the invididual variables for each exercise

### Outside API's

This would mostly just require the user's own experience so there's a chance I wont need any.

### Relevant Books or Articles

Books or articles that list exercises could be useful to import into the app.

### Tasks

1. What UI do I need to make an app on app store
2. What programs to I need to make my app
3. Find API for exercises, form, and advice
4. Learn programs needed for app
5. Find out how to incorporate api into my app
6. Learn relevant programming languages (maybe python for example)
7. Develop Name of App
8. Plan color pallet of app (no red), save hex code to some gdoc perhaps
9. Draw a design home page of app, what buttons would be where
10. Draw a designs/ find images for decorations/buttons
11. Find sound effects to be used upon completion of exercise/button press; or just general sound effects
12. Find list of exercises I might have presets for
13. Research how to code working timer

### ACTUAL CODE
14. Create Home Page (may include a 7 day schedule, showing what day of your routine it is)
15. Create Links/Buttons to Weightlifting Tab, Cardio Tab, Maybe a seperate tab for timer
16. Create weightlifting home page
17. Add Link to list of weightlifting exercises, with advice for form listed next to each exercise
18. Add ways to edit your routine for each day from weightlifting tab
19. Add way to track your personal records under each exercise
20. Last section for personal notes under each exercise
21. List exercises under groups (ie muscle worked/push pull legs) to make search easier:
22. Create Cardio Home Page
23. Hopefully find settings for different company treadmills to see if different settings equal same intensity across types
24. Add recommended Cardio routine, which is editable by user
25. Also add way to track previous record based on time, incline, and speed
26. Create Timer Page
27. After completion of an exercise, shows recommended rest time based on previous experience
28. Timer is alot more friendly that actual timer app (most time I dont want to use the alarm because it is loud, but the stopwatch doesnt remind you after hitting 2 minutes for example. I will find a mix between the two)
29. If progress is slowing down perhaps show a notification to change something up with so and so exercises
30. Show recommended supplements (protein powder, creatine, preworkout) plus recommended brands with their benefits
31. Maybe show recommended gyms, based on location, and available machines (need to do research for this)
32. Recommended snacks, healthy cheat meals, ways to make room for oreos
